          <h1>Work hard </h1>
          <p>Sometimes, no matter how important your goals are to you, it's a struggle to bring your best effort to your gym session (or work up the motivation to make it happen at all). But whether you're trying to lose weight, train for a race, keep your stress in check, or any of the other worthwhile reasons to make fitness a part of your life, staying consistent is key, even when you really, really, really don't feel like it. When you're struggling to remember why it's worth all the effort, these 14 fitness quotes will give you the push you need. Consider these gems of fitness inspiration the antidote to your temporarily unenthusiastic fitness 'tude—or save them for any time you need a little extra boost to get you moving, mind, body, and soul.

          </p>
          <p>
            Lacking motivation to get back into the gym? Back in the gym already but feel stagnated? Or maybe you’re just looking for new inspiration for a the new year. Whatever your situation, reading words of wisdom from successful people can be super-inspiring.

          <h1>All progress takes place outside the comfort zone</h1>
          <p>
            We all have our personal comfortable place, which is always so COZY and relaxing. We don’t like it if anything OUT OF BOX happens in those boundaries. It brings panic, burden and irritation to us. It’s is very hard to bring people out of that and put them in the situation totally different than their DEN. But what you need to understand is there are always BETTER things waiting for you on the other side. There is always a place for improvement in whatever you do. When you will open yourself to try something new, it will help you in increasing your knowledge and confidence.

          <h2>Marshalads</h2>
          <p><b>Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as self-defense; military and law enforcement applications; competition; physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.[1]

            Although the term martial art has become associated with the fighting arts of East Asia, it originally referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from Latin and means "arts of Mars", the Roman god of war.[2] Some authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never "martial" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.[3]
            Martial arts can also be linked with religion and spirituality. Numerous systems are reputed to have been founded, disseminated, or practiced by monks or nuns.

            <h2>Boxing</h2>
            <p><b>Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other  protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.

              Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds.
              
              A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, then professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.

              <h2>Gym</h2>
              <p><b>Gymnasia apparatuses such as barbells, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, and fencing area are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.[2] Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.[3]

                Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them.[4] Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports.
